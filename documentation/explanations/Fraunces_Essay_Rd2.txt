Meet Fraunces, a new "Old Style" typeface family by Charles&Thorn
By Spencer Charles

In the early summer of 2018, Google Fonts approached us with the challenge of designing a display typeface. I spent some time perusing the catalog, and was struck by a pretty big hole in the typographic voices available. There isn't a specific name for this genre, but typefaces such as Cooper Black, Windsor, and Souvenir personify it. 

The origin of this genre traces its roots back to the Arts & Crafts experimentations of the late 1800's—early 1900's. Golden Type by William Morris, and the extensive lettering of the Roycroft Guild captured this romanticized idea of an "Old Style" that their contemporaries had lost touch with.

Ironically, the letters they created, and the fad of wonky "Old Style" typefaces that it spawned in subsequent decades (such as Cooper Black, Windsor, Clearface) had little-to-nothing to do with typefaces of antiquity. Morris' Golden Type was an extremely crude interpretation of the types of Nicolas Jenson, opting instead to emphasize the perceived effects of printing, rather than the calligraphic origins of the form.

Fast forward to the 1970's, when graphic designers were looking for more funky stylings, and the irreverence of these typefaces were the perfect antidote to the perceived stuffiness of traditional text faces. Ed Benguiat drew a swashy version of Bookman for ITC, an ode to Oswald Cooper's Cooper Black Italic, which has become ubiquitous with the "Thank You For Shopping With Us" grocery bags.

Fraunces is not an Old Style typeface, but an "Old Style" typeface. That is, a genre of type that is less concerned with sensible construction of letterforms, and personality is always paramount.
